					<h4 class="shop-info__name">General</h4>
					<p class="shop-info__text">By ordering the Products and/or accepting delivery of the Products from Shop,
						the Customer agrees that it is bound by these Terms and Conditions of sale. Customer orders, including
						orders placed via the internet, are subject to acceptance by Shop. The acceptance of the Customer's
						order by Shop is expressly made conditional upon the Customer's assent to these Terms and Conditions
						which will prevail notwithstanding anything that may be stated to the contrary on the Customer's
						order. Shop reserves the right to vary any of these terms at any time and any subsequent orders placed
						by the Customer will constitute an acceptance of the terms as varied. Once a Customer order has been
						placed and accepted by Shop, the Customer agrees that the Customer has no right to cancel or vary the
						order at any time, unless agreed upon in writing by both parties.</p>
					<h4 class="shop-info__name">Quotations</h4>
					<p class="shop-info__text">Any quotation by Shop to the Customer will be open for acceptance by the
						Customer within the period stated in the quotation or, where no period is stated, within seven (7)
						days from the date of the quotation. Thereafter, prices stated in the quotation may be varied by Shop
						without notice to the Customer.</p>
					<h4 class="shop-info__name">
						Prices / Taxes</h4>
					<p class="shop-info__text">The prices charged by and payable to Shop will be the ruling prices applicable
						at the time of order placement, provided that the Products are accepted for delivery within a
						reasonable time. Prices are subject to change without notice. Recommended retail prices are provided
						for indicative purposes only and there is no obligation for Shop to comply with that recommendation.
						It as agreed that should the Customer fail for any reason to acquire the quantity of Products sold
						then without limiting Shop' other rights and remedies the unit price charged for the goods sold may be
						amended to take into account any variation in the total quantity purchased by the Customer. Prices
						include GST, but do not include any other tax or duty, which is in addition to the price and is to be
						paid by the Customer at the time of payment for the Products.</p>
